# Plant_Tracker

This project has been created due to my personal passion for indoor plants. Having tried to use apps such as planta etc. to track watering habits and plant health, I decided to have a go making a personal tracker. This would provide a more tailored experience whilst also allowing me to learn some new technologies at the same time.
